# CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIX - Upload Failure Resolution

## Commit Message
```
fix: Critical upload failure - correct API URL and CORS configuration

- Fixed VERCEL.env: Changed NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL from frontend URL to Railway backend
- Updated CORS configuration to include edgetoolspro.com domain
- Fixed backend CORS middleware to properly parse environment variable
- Updated package.json to resolve build deprecation warnings
- Created comprehensive production environment setup documentation

BREAKING CHANGE: Requires immediate environment variable update in Vercel dashboard
```

## Files Changed
1. `VERCEL.env` - Fixed NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to point to Railway backend
2. `RAILWAY.env` - Updated CORS_ORIGINS to include new domain
3. `backend/.env` - Updated CORS_ORIGINS for local development
4. `backend/app/main.py` - Fixed CORS middleware configuration
5. `frontend/package.json` - Fixed deprecation warnings
6. `PRODUCTION_ENV_SETUP.md` - Created deployment fix guide

## Deployment Steps After Commit

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Critical upload failure - correct API URL and CORS configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Update Vercel Environment Variables IMMEDIATELY
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project (Project ID: prj_RiidhWzXBlBbqjTInnAw5CpL8yu8)
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Find `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
5. Change value to: `https://lucky-spirit-production.up.railway.app`
6. Save and Redeploy

### 3. Update Railway Environment Variables
1. Go to: https://railway.app/project/f0f0b42b-1a0e-412f-b626-44b21297f36a
2. Go to Variables tab
3. Update `CORS_ORIGINS` to: `https://edgetoolspro.com,https://www.edgetoolspro.com,https://nda-redline-tool.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000`
4. Railway will auto-redeploy

### 4. Verify Fix
1. Wait for both deployments to complete (3-5 minutes)
2. Open https://edgetoolspro.com
3. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
4. Upload a test .docx file
5. Verify the API call goes to `lucky-spirit-production.up.railway.app`
6. Check for no CORS errors in console

## Root Cause Analysis
The upload was failing because:
1. **Primary Issue**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` was set to the frontend URL (`https://nda-redline-tool.vercel.app/`) instead of the Railway backend
2. **Secondary Issue**: CORS wasn't configured to accept the new domain `edgetoolspro.com`
3. **Code Issue**: Backend wasn't properly parsing the CORS_ORIGINS environment variable

## What This Fix Does
1. **Corrects API routing**: Frontend now calls the Railway backend instead of itself
2. **Enables CORS**: Backend now accepts requests from edgetoolspro.com
3. **Improves security**: Specific CORS origins instead of wildcard
4. **Fixes build warnings**: Updates deprecated packages

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload a small .docx file (< 1MB)
- [ ] Upload a medium .docx file (5-10MB)
- [ ] Verify progress updates stream
- [ ] Test download after processing
- [ ] Check no CORS errors in console
- [ ] Verify no 404 errors on API calls
- [ ] Test that old domain still works
